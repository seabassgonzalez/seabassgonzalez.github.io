                <p>Throughout my many varied positions, the application of technology has been a constant. I graduated from Oregon State University with a Bachelor’s in Political Science in 2011 having hoped to pursue a law degree. I found a career in law was not my passion after working as a paralegal for a few years, but the theme of applying technology was prevalent. As the resident millennial, my knowledge of web technologies was leveraged to redesign the firm’s website. As a result of my experience, I felt comfortable transitioning to a position of web master for thefitnessoutlet.com where I managed the storefront using HTML, XML, and CSS. I also assisted my mother, a high school teacher and college professor, in managing her online courses and various multimedia materials. I was able to apply everything I had learned when I got the opportunity to work as an Instructional Web Designer at the Academy of Art University. </p>
                <p>Creating online coursework using established frameworks enticed me to wonder how exactly all the tools I used were designed and built, how it all worked. I began learning javascript on various free learning websites and found it absolutely intriguing. I knew what I was doing was only scratching the surface, but it motivated me enough to want to learn all javascript could do. I began attending local javascript meetups in San Francisco to gain insight into what I needed to learn next, refining my chops at technical meetups like those hosted by Hack Reactor, the web dev bootcamp. I participated in several preparatory courses by Hack Reactor including Fulcrum, a nine week intensive introduction to basic javascript including challenges such as a reimplementation of the underscore library. From Big-O notation, to algorithms and javascript implementations of computer science data structures, I was enamored at all the learning I had before me, but I knew I needed to commit more time. I decided to leave my position as an Instructional Web Designer to learn javascript and computer science full time. I participated in and won at the 2016 AT&T Shape Hackathon for a project I made involving Honda’s Uni-cub vehicle https://youtu.be/UFWoCMBv7eY. I’ve spent my time learning the basics of MongoDB, Express, Angular, React, and Node. </p>
