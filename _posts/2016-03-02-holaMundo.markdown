¡Hola! Mucho gusto, me llamo Sebastián Alejandro González. I’ve started this blog to document my journey at Telegraph Academy, a programming bootcamp in the Hack Reactor Core network of schools.

It’s my goal to document my personal development over the next few months, hopefully making this rigorous path accessible to others who’ve felt inspired, but intimidated by Computer Science. Like many self-directed learners, I’ve found [tons of resources](https://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome-psyapi2&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8&q=learn%20web%20development&oq=learn%20web%20development&aqs=chrome.0.0l6.2766j0j9) for beginners, but a clear roadmap for the deeper knowledge needed to be prepared for an intense web development bootcamp is not readily available.

Many pay-per-use courses and deeper tutorials ARE available for the determined Googler, but having completed many of them myself, I can attest to being left with a clear feeling that we’re missing something. We can’t put into words exactly what we don’t know, but [we don’t know what we don’t know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiPe1OiKQuk). Dark and obscure; looming.

Computer Science is one of the last disciplines in modern times embodying the endless possibilities of the Americano Dream. The opportunities it can afford obligate us to take on that deeper knowledge. The challenge can be mightily rewarded. On the heels of arguably the most significant day in modern American Democracy “Super Tuesday,” 2016, we should not ignore the significance of the Sanders and Trump campaigns as [reflective of deeper woes](http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-03-01/the-angry-americans-trump-sanders-and-the-aftershocks-of-2008).

Like many Americans today, the years since the “Great Recession” have been exceedingly difficult for me. Like others struggling to survive in our tumultuous economy, I’ve been a “Juan de Todos Oficios.” A common undercurrent that I was privileged to be able to employ was my comfort with technology. In fact, it’s application and use directly correlated with my increasing earnings from job to job.  I personally know the power that technical knowledge can have in changing one’s life, and the lives of those around them. I personally know that lacking a formal background in the STEM fields is not an insurmountable barrier into this field. I hope my discussion of some of the speed bumps I encountered are helpful for others on this path.

In solidarity,

Sebastián
