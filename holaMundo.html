                    <p>¡Hola! Mucho gusto, me llamo Sebastián Alejandro González. I’ve started this blog to document my journey at Telegraph Academy, a programming bootcamp in the Hack Reactor Core network of schools.</p>

                    <p>It’s my goal to document my personal development over the next few months, hopefully making this rigorous path accessible to others who’ve felt inspired, but intimidated by Computer Science. Like many self-directed learners, I’ve found [tons of resources](https://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome-psyapi2&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8&q=learn%20web%20development&oq=learn%20web%20development&aqs=chrome.0.0l6.2766j0j9) for beginners, but a clear roadmap for the deeper knowledge needed to be prepared for an intense web development bootcamp is not readily available.</p>

                    <p>Many pay-per-use courses and deeper tutorials ARE available for the determined Googler, but having completed many of them myself, I can attest to being left with a clear feeling that we’re missing something. We can’t put into words exactly what we don’t know, but [we don’t know what we don’t know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiPe1OiKQuk). Dark and obscure; looming.</p>

                    <p>Computer Science is one of the last disciplines in modern times embodying the endless possibilities of the Americano Dream. The opportunities it can afford obligate us to take on that deeper knowledge. The challenge can be mightily rewarded. On the heels of arguably the most significant day in modern American Democracy “Super Tuesday,” 2016, we should not ignore the significance of the Sanders and Trump campaigns as [reflective of deeper woes](http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-03-01/the-angry-americans-trump-sanders-and-the-aftershocks-of-2008).</p>

                    <p>Like many Americans today, the years since the “Great Recession” have been exceedingly difficult for me. Like others struggling to survive in our tumultuous economy, I’ve been a “Juan de Todos Oficios.” A common undercurrent that I was privileged to be able to employ was my comfort with technology. In fact, it’s application and use directly correlated with my increasing earnings from job to job.  I personally know the power that technical knowledge can have in changing one’s life, and the lives of those around them. I personally know that lacking a formal background in the STEM fields is not an insurmountable barrier into this field. I hope my discussion of some of the speed bumps I encountered are helpful for others on this path.</p>

                    <p>In solidarity,</p>

                    <p>Sebastián</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>

                    <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

                    <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

                    <blockquote>The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

                    <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

                    <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

                    <span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span>

                    <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

                    <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
